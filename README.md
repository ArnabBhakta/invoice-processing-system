##Project Description: Invoice Processing System

Overview:

The Invoice Processing System is a sophisticated application designed to automate and streamline the management of invoices. This system enables users to track pending invoices, manage vendor information, and keep detailed records of purchased products, amounts, and payment statuses.
Key Functionalities:-

1.	Pending Invoices Management:
o	Users can view a list of all pending invoices that require attention.
o	Each invoice includes detailed information such as the vendor, purchased product, amount, purchase date, and current status.

2.	Vendor Information:
o	The system allows users to store and manage vendor details.
o	Users can track from which vendor a product was purchased, ensuring accurate record-keeping and easy reference.

3.	Product Details:
o	For each invoice, the system records the specific product purchased.
o	Users can see what product was bought, including the description, quantity, and price.

4.	Financial Tracking:
o	The application records the amount of each product purchased, providing a clear financial overview.
o	Users can track the total cost associated with each invoice.

5.	Purchase Date Tracking:
o	Each invoice includes the purchase date, allowing users to sort and filter invoices based on when the transaction occurred.
o	This feature aids in timely follow-ups and financial planning.

6.	Invoice Status:
o	The system clearly indicates the status of each invoice (e.g., pending, cleared).
o	Users can easily see whether a bill has been paid or is still outstanding.

7.	Mark as Done:
	
  Once an invoice is paid, users can mark it as cleared by clicking the "Mark Done" button.

  This updates the status of the invoice and removes it from the pending list, ensuring accurate and up-to-date records.

Frontend:-

Technologies Used:

•	ReactJS: The frontend was built using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS was chosen for its component-based architecture, allowing for the creation of reusable UI components and a dynamic, responsive user experience.

•	Material-UI: To enhance the visual appeal and ensure a consistent design, Material-UI was integrated into the project. This library provided a range of pre-designed components that follow Google's Material Design principles, ensuring a professional and intuitive interface.

Backend:-
Technologies Used:

•	Spring Boot: The backend services were developed using Spring Boot, a Java-based framework that simplifies the development of stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications. Spring Boot was selected for its ability to reduce boilerplate code, facilitate easy configuration, and support a wide range of features out-of-the-box.

•	Hibernate: For Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), Hibernate was utilized to manage database interactions. Hibernate simplified the process of data handling, ensuring efficient communication between the application and the database.

Database:-

Technology Used:

•	MySQL: The application relies on MySQL, a robust and widely-used relational database management system. MySQL was chosen for its reliability, performance, and ease of use. It effectively handles the storage, retrieval, and management of invoice data.

Conclusion:-
The Invoice Processing System is a well-rounded solution that leverages modern technologies to improve the efficiency of handling invoices. By combining ReactJS and Material-UI on the frontend with Spring Boot and Hibernate on the backend, and using MySQL for data management, this project ensures a seamless, efficient, and user-friendly experience.
